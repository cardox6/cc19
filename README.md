It is as a student project at Code University of Applied Sciences. 

### Technologies 
Built with HTML, CSS (styling and animation), JavaScript, Python, Flask, Dialogflow.

### Deployment 
The project has been conceived in an environment, therefore Requirements should be met in order to avoid incompatibilities. The website has been deployed on a Google Cloud Server (Ubunt 18). Files are  dinamically handled by Gunicorn, calling on Nginx for static files.
The executable file for flask is covid19.py, the command 'flask run' should do the trick. 
The executable for Gunicorn is wsgi.py for deployment of workers.

### Responsive
The web is built responsive for Desktop, Mobile (Iphone X), Tablet(Ipad).
